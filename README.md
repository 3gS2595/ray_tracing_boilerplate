## 3D Ray Tracer
Renders either an image or animation of a 3D scene, accounts for lights and camera
positioning, 3D models, and spheres. Program supports geometric
modeling, illumination, shadow, reflectance, and materiality. outputs images in ppm. and .gif.

implemented entirely from the ground up through lenear algebra operations, calculating the color values of each pixel as the vector(ray) bounces around the scene

(supports .obj and .mtl 3d models)
