## 3D Ray Tracer
Renders image or animation of 3D scene, accounts for lights, camera positioning, 3D models, and spheres. 
geometric models, illumination, shadow, reflectance, and materiality. outputs images in ppm. and .gif.

implemented entirely from the ground up through lenear algebra operations, calculating pixel color values through ray casting and subsequent ray reflection within the scene

(supports .obj/.mtl 3d models) 
(main method: src/java/Raytracer/Raytracer.java)
